# sensorserver
Project for sensor server for my master thesis. The server side will be based on Node.js and frontend, react. The server will use MongoDB.

### How to run

1. git clone https://github.com/henninghaakonsen/sensorserver
2. Install with 'npm install' or with 'yarn install' (faster)
3. Run with 'npm start'
4. Navigate to http://localhost:9000/

If you would like a new UI to be hosted by this server, build the sensor app(https://github.com/henninghaakonsen/sensorapp) and replace the file "sensorserver/src/app/public/main.js"
